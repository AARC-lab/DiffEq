# Solving Differential Equations for Real-world Problems
## 1. Follow-the-leader model

$$
 \dot{x}_i = v_i
$$

$$
 \dot{v}_i = \beta\cfrac{\Delta v}{s_i^2}
$$

$$
 s_i = x_{i-1} - x_i - L
$$

$$
\Delta v_i = v_{i-1} - v_{i}
$$

Note: Page 3 has a typo. $\Delta v_i = v_i - v_{i-1}$ should be $\Delta v_i = v_{i-1} - v_{i}$.
